title: Applied AI Project Page Autumn 2020
---
We are a team of master students at Oslo Metropolitan University, embarking on an Applied Artificial Intelligence project.

## Reduce risk of Covid-19 infection in an educational setting
The project aim is to use Machine Learning and simulation to better understand how to minimize Covid-19 spread in an educational campus setting.

## GitHub pages
This is an early test of using GitHub pages with jekyll which transforms page templates in markdown (.md) format to html.
There are two options for using GitHub pages.

### Two separate repositories (one for the project code and one for the project website)
This option is to have 
1) a repository for the project code
2) a separate repository for GitHub pages which has the same name as the github user account or organization in our case.

In our case the repository name is: acit4040-ai-simulation.github.io which matches our GitHub organization, and the files for the webpage will be in the master branch of this repository.

#### URL-format when using dedicated separate repository for our organization for GitHub Pages
- https://GITHUB-ORGANIZATION-NAME.github.io 
- **https://acit4040-ai-simulation.github.io/** (in our case)

### One repostory where a dedicated branch serves the project website
In this option we only use one repository. The the code will be in master branch or other branches, and we will serve GitHub pages from **gh-pages branch**)

The pages will look identical, but the url to GitHub pages will be a little different.

#### URL-format when using dedicated branch for GitHub Pages
- https://GITHUB-ORG-NAME.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME
- **https://acit4040-ai-simulation.github.io/AAI-Simulation-Project** (in our case)

## Code
Currently there is no content in the project repository:

[Project repository](https://github.com/ACIT4040-AI-simulation/AAI-Simulation-Project)

More information will follow as the project progresses.
